# GroupB-Final

This project is an interactive audio-reactive art piece that combines visual and musical elements to create an immersive experience. Using the p5.js library's FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) function, the project analyzes the low-frequency components of an audio signal (20-250 Hz) and translates them into dynamic visual effects, influencing the movement, size, and color of various geometric shapes on the screen, such as circles and arcs.

At the core of the project are multiple "dynamic circles" (instances of MyCircleClass), each with a position and size affected by the frequency and amplitude of the audio. Users can interact with the piece by clicking to play or pause the background music, enhancing the sense of engagement. Each circle animates differently according to the bass energy, changing in size and position to create a rhythmic visual effect.

The background also includes static elements, like rectangles and semicircles, which adjust their size and color based on audio frequency, adding aesthetic depth to the scene. This design combines artistry with interactivity, making it suitable for showcasing audio visualization and interactive digital art. It highlights the potential of digital art to merge music and visual effects for a captivating sensory experience.
